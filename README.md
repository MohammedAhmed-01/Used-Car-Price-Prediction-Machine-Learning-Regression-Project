# -Used-Car-Price-Prediction-Machine-Learning-Regression-Project
This project focuses on building a **data-driven system to predict used car prices** using machine learning regression techniques.   With the rapid growth of the used car market and the absence of standardized pricing, this project aims to provide **objective, fair, and accurate price estimation** based on real vehicle attributes.
